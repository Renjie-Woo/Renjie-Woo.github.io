<!--Computer Science, **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**. 
-->
I'm interested in the general field of **Data Mining** and **Machine Learning**. Particularly, I aspire to solve real-world problems using Machine Learning techniques. Big Data itself cannot be utilized and well-understood. I want to be a data scientist who is able to turn data into knowledge which, in the long run, make impacts and improve the living standard of human society.

<!--Currently, I am working as a research intern of the City Brain project on **intelligent traffic signal control**, advised by [Prof. **Zhenhui Jessie Li**](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jessieli).-->

## Research Experience

### Deep Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control 
_Research Intern, Advisor: Prof. Zhenhui (Jessie) Li Jul.2018 - Present_  

- Designed and implemented a reinforcement learning (RL) approach with justification on state and reward design for multi-intersection traffic signal control along arterials
- Draw a connection between RL method and classical transportation theory for the first time
- Justified our RL model in comparison to the closed form solution under the same simplified experiment settings
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance in simulation on both synthetic and real-world traffic data
- Started conducting field experiments in Hangzhou China
